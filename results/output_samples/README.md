# Output Samples
In this directory, you will find output samples synthesized by the trained model from this study (link to be updated), along with samples from other sources. These samples encompass various utterances generated using different models and methods.

## Explanation:
Within this directory, you'll find samples generated from different sources, all originating from the same text.

**1. Natural**

<ul>
  Contains natural utterances, representing the original, unaltered recordings. These recordings serve as the baseline for comparison.
</ul>

**2. Mana-TTS** [Link to be updated]

<ul>
  Corresponds to the model developed in this study (link to be updated). The Mana-TTS directory contains output samples synthesized by our model.
</ul>

**3. Glow-TTS** [[source](https://huggingface.co/Kamtera/persian-tts-female-glow_tts)]

<ul>
  Contains output samples synthesized using the Glow-TTS model.
</ul>

**4. VITS-TTS** [[source](https://huggingface.co/Kamtera/persian-tts-female-vits)]

<ul>
  Includes output samples synthesized using the VITS-TTS model.
</ul>

**5. Golden-Spectrogram-HiFiGAN-Waveform**

<ul>
  This source includes utterances with gold spectrograms and HiFiGAN-generated waveforms. These samples help assess the main models' spectrogram generation ability independently of the vocoder's role.
</ul>
